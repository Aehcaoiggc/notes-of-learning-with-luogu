# notes-of-learning-with-luogu
I record all the questions I have done so that I can check them after.

I creat this repository for learning. Not only for C++, Markdown, algorithm, English, but also how to use [Github](www.github.com).

As a student who is not a computer major, I still want to learn some new things. 

Wish you having a good day and enjoying yourself.
